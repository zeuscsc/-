I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw and only zh-tw. Double check if the output is all zh-tw.
The Year is 1912.

```Current Chapter Key Points
Another day in the Bosnische Post office. Author call me to go to his office again.
He told me those Serbian Students is out of their line these days. The country need to beat them and teach them a lesson.
He yall at me and order me to write a editorial on the problem on too much freedom for students and encourage the population to stop them.
"He who wants to live, let him die. He who wants to die, let him live, We always have a choice" Princip voice pop up in my head.
I go back to my seat and take out the resignation letter I prepared long time ago. I go back to Author's office and mumbling "I want to quit". Author raise up his voice "What did you just say?". I take a deep breath and shout out "Here is my resignation letter!" and turn back and leave the office.
Although I am still a bit worry about the money for livings, but I have never felt so releaveing.
Eventhrough I quit the job, I still plan to use what I do best for a living and support the cause.
```

```Pervious Chapters Key Features
In early 20th-century Sarajevo, a journalist named Bosko navigates his disillusionment with the Austro-Hungarian Empire's dominance and propaganda, encapsulated by his work at the Bosnische Post. Despite being surrounded by the oppressive atmosphere and the stark contrast between proclaimed imperial "progress" and the actual hardships faced by Bosnian Serbs, Bosko harbors secret sympathies towards the Pan-Slavic movement. In a chance encounter, he meets Gavrilo Princip and Nedeljko Čabrinović, young revolutionaries who challenge his compliance with the Empire's narratives. As Bosko struggles between his professional duties and personal beliefs, his interactions with Princip highlight the youth's fervent passion for independence and justice, in stark opposition to the journalist's conflicted soul. Princip shares stories of their bold public protests and direct, sometimes violent, methods of political activism, leading to his expulsion from school. Later during a visit, Princip presents Bosko a song, inspired by Bogdan Žerajić's martyrdom, reflecting on themes of sacrifice, freedom, and the dichotomy of life and death. Bosko, having criticized Žerajić in his previous editorial under editorial pressure, feels remorse for his actions but sees hope in Princip's conviction. Princip's steadfast belief in their cause and the depth of his thoughts force Bosko to examine his own role and potential for courage in the face of overwhelming imperial pressures. Through their interactions, Bosko is pushed to confront uncomfortable truths about his role in perpetuating the Empire's control and the value of aligning with a cause broader than personal safety and career advancement.

``` Pervious Chapter
那天，普林西普來我家拜訪，帶來了他新寫的歌。他有些靦腆地將幾張紙遞給我，請求我讀讀看，然後告訴他我的想法。

歌曲的歌詞以塞爾維亞語寫成，字跡帶著年輕人特有的筆跡，歌詞本身並不複雜，旋律也帶著年輕人常有的憂鬱。但當我讀到其中一行時，心頭卻猛然一震，那是一種難以言喻的震撼。

「欲生者，令其死；欲死者，令其生。」

我抬起頭，望向普林西普，眼神中充滿疑問。「普林西普，這是什麼意思？」我輕聲問道。

普林西普冷靜地看著我，他的眼神深邃而平靜，用一種與他年輕外表不太相符的沉穩語氣回答：「博斯科先生，真正的活著有意義的生存、自由、成就更偉大的目標，或許需要我們犧牲肉體的生命。」他頓了頓，又補充說：「執著於苟且偷生，逃避風險，從某種意義上來說，反而是一種目的和影響力上的死亡。」

我愣住了，他的話語彷彿帶著一種超越年齡的成熟與深刻，那並非只是年輕人的熱血衝動，而是一種歷經沉澱後的篤定，讓我一時之間不知該如何回應。普林西普繼續說，這句話是受到哲拉伊奇的啟示。哲拉伊奇，那個深深啟發他的人。普林西普接著又帶著一絲不解與困惑說，他不明白那些老一輩的人為什麼總覺得他瘋了，難道追求理想與自由是瘋狂的嗎？他的語氣中帶著一絲委屈，一絲憤慨，更有一絲堅定，彷彿在向這個充滿誤解的世界發出無聲的抗議。

哲拉伊奇這個名字聽起來非常熟悉。我努力在記憶深處搜尋，試圖想起這個名字背後所代表的意義。終於，我像是抓住了什麼。「普林西普，你說的是博格丹·哲拉伊奇嗎？」我再次確認道。

普林西普點點頭，肯定地說是的。

一股難以言喻的歉疚感瞬間湧上心頭，像冰冷的水流淌過全身，讓我感到一陣寒意。

我艱澀地開口，望著普林西普年輕卻堅定的臉龐，坦誠地告訴他，我很抱歉。我向他坦承，之前我曾迫於報社的壓力，寫過一篇社論，批判精神疾病患者對社會秩序的負面影響，而且在文章中，我還曾以哲拉伊奇的「英雄行為」作為一個負面例子來佐證我的觀點。

普林西普沉默了，只是靜靜地看著我，眼神複雜難明，他的眼神中似乎有著一絲失望，又似乎帶著某種理解。我接著試圖解釋，我當時也是迫於無奈。我曾經嘗試修改那篇社論，希望能偷偷加入一些反對奧匈帝國的內容，但報社的主編在文章發表前發現並毫不猶豫地刪除了那些段落。

普林西普聽完我的解釋，輕聲說他理解我的處境。但他隨即又語重心長地說，人永遠都有選擇。「博斯科先生，記住這句話，」他再次重複，「欲生者，令其死；欲死者，令其生。」他的話語中帶著一種堅定的力量，彷彿在提醒我，即使在最艱難的環境下，人依然可以做出自己的選擇。

我望著他年輕卻堅毅的面龐，由衷地說道，我希望能像他一樣勇敢，並且我正在努力，希望能成為一個更勇敢、更真實的記者。

普林西普聽了我的話，微微一笑，臉上露出了些許欣慰，氣氛也稍微緩和了一些。我們又回到歌曲的話題上，繼續討論他的創作，以及歌曲中想要表達的更深層的意涵。
