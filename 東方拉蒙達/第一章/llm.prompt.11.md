I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw and only zh-tw. Double check if the output is all zh-tw.
The Year is 1912.
The main Character is a 23 Years old Serbian Journalist who works in (Bosnische Post) name "Bosco" (博斯科) who live in Bosnia.
The story would be told from the main character (Bosco) point of view, alike a documentary.
No need to create any name except the definded characters.
The chapter would be like this:

Remember you need to follow my above points for my current chapter first then reference the following example. Also the example may have too much details that is not related to the main points, too much details may make readers hard to read. Good descriptive ability is important but don't add to much that is not related to the main story points from above. Only give me the final modified version
Following are some extra examples from the above outline:

Here is the pervious Chapter for reference:
