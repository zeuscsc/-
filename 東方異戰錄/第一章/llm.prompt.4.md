I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw.
The year would be 1913 May
The main Character is a Serbia Journalists name "Serbosco Petrovic" (塞爾博斯科·彼得羅維奇)
The second character is a Romania Journalists name "Romilia Ionescu " (羅米莉亞·約內斯庫)
The third character is a Bulgarian Journalists name "Bogdan Dimitrov" (博格丹·季米特洛夫)
The story would be told from the main character (Serbosco) point of view, alike a documentary.
The chapter would be like this:
All 3 Journalists arrive in Wallachia by train.
Early days in Wallachia spent in archives, talking to historians, and visiting towns and villages.
They decide to explore the nearby Wallachian forests, where many of Vlad's legendary battles were fought, despite Romilia's initial hesitations.
They decide the real story is beyond cities, in the landscapes connected to the heroes (fortresses, forests).
They hire a local guide and a cart to film in the Wallachian countryside.
They move onto increasingly less defined paths, guided by local lore.
Deep in the Wallachian forest, the path disappears completely.
The local guide becomes unsure and worried.
The cart wheels become trapped in the dense undergrowth.
As the day fades, they realize they are lost, with the forest seemingly shifting around them, making navigation nearly impossible.
A thick fog begins to roll in, reducing visibility and amplifying the sense of isolation.
The fog inexplicably turns a disturbing shade of red, adding an unsettling and potentially supernatural element to their predicament.
They started to hear some strange noise, sounds like animal approching.


Following are the key features from pervious chapters:
In May 1913, amidst the backdrop of the Balkan League's victory over the Ottoman Empire, three Balkan journalists – Serbian Serbosco, Romanian Romilia, and Bulgarian Bogdan – met in a Bucharest café to discuss Romania's neutrality in the conflict. Inspired by Romilia's idea to ignite Romanian patriotism, they conceived a plan to create a journal and embark on a documentary project focusing on Romanian national heroes Stephen the Great and Vlad III.  Driven by a shared passion for journalism and Balkan unity, they set off on a train journey to Wallachia, eager to delve into history and inspire their nation to embrace a more active role in the changing European landscape.

Remember you need to follow my above points for my current chapter first then reference the following example. Also the example may have too much details that is not related to the main points, too much details may make readers hard to read. Good descriptive ability is important but don't add to much that is not related to the main story points from above. Only give me the final modified version
Following is some extra example from the above outline:
