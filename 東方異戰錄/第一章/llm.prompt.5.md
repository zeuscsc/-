I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw.
The year would be 1913 May
The main Character is a Serbia Journalists name "Serbosco Petrovic" (塞爾博斯科·彼得羅維奇)
The second character is a Romania Journalists name "Romilia Ionescu " (羅米莉亞·約內斯庫)
The third character is a Bulgarian Journalists name "Bogdan Dimitrov" (博格丹·季米特洛夫)
The story would be told from the main character (Serbosco) point of view, alike a documentary.
The chapter would be like this:
A beast appear.
The local guide ran away.
Beast Try to Attack Romania.
Bulgarian rush forward and blocked the attack.
I pull my gun and kill the beast.
Bulgarian got hurt and blood dripping.


Following are the key features from pervious chapters:
In a café in Bucharest, three journalists, Serbosko, Romilia, and Bogdan, discuss the Balkan League's victory in the Balkan War and Romania's puzzling neutrality. Inspired to ignite Romanian patriotism and advocate for joining the Balkan movement, they conceive of a journal and then decide to produce a documentary about Vlad the Impaler, a national hero, hoping to inspire the Romanian populace and influence political decisions. Embarking on their project, they journey to Wallachia and venture into its forests to research Vlad's legacy.  However, as they delve deeper into the Wallachian forests, they become lost in a pervasive red mist, encountering unsettling and potentially supernatural phenomena, creating an atmosphere of mystery and foreboding that hints at more than just historical research awaiting them.

Good descriptive ability is important but don't add to much that is not related to the main story points from above. Only give me the final modified version
Following is some extra example from the above outline:
