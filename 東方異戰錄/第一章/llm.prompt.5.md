I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw.
Following are the key points for current chapter:
The interior of the Scarlet Mansion is much larger than it looks from the outside, it have lots of red rooms and looks spooky.
After a long walk, we entered a hall, a throne room. There is a girl on the throne, she looks majesty and dignity.
Her hair is short and light blue. The eyes are blood red. Wearing a pale pink hat on her head, there is a large red bow tied on the left side of the hat. There is also a big bow tied at the back of the clothes.
She told me I have her premission to stay one night because I look lost in the woods and I am welcome to join dinner with them.

Following are the key features from pervious chapter:
The main Character is a reporter name Bosco.
I, a skeptical Serbian reporter for a local supernatural news paper, is sent to Transylvania to investigate a story about ancient runes, which he believes is fake news. Set right before World War I, I views this trip as a paid vacation.  During his journey, he reads a Serbian newspaper and is angered by Austria-Hungary's influence in the Balkan peace conference, desiring a strong and independent Serbia. Upon arriving in Transylvania, he finds a modern city but also notes political tension and nationalist sentiments similar to Serbia. I quickly debunks the supernatural story and, with free time, visits a bar. There, he meets Serbian teenagers, including one named Gavrilo, who share his nationalistic views and encourage him to visit a village near Bran Castle, claiming to have seen something incredible.  Although initially dismissive, I decides to visit the village as he has time.
As I go more and more near the village, the fog become thicker and thicker. I think I have lost in the woods. As I open the Scarlet invitation, the fog suddenly turn red. I turn up my head, I saw a red huge red Moon. It was like what they told me, everything was like under a red filter.
As I keep walking, I found a Scarlet Mansion within the woods.  I took a image with my camera.
A maiden was welcomeing me.
She has short silver hair with sideburns on both sides, tied into small braids with green ribbons at the ends. Scarlet Red Eyes, The clothing is a maid outfit with blue and white as the main colors.

Remember you need to follow my above points for my current chapter first then reference the following example. Also the example may have too much details that is not related to the main points, too much details may make readers hard to read. Good descriptive ability is important but don't add to much that is not related to the main story points from above. Only give me the final modified version
Following is some extra example from the above outline:
推開緋紅洋館沉重的大門，映入眼簾的景象與外觀截然不同。屋內空間遠比想像中廣闊幽深，彷彿踏入了一座深邃的迷宮。空氣中瀰漫著一股難以言喻的霉味，暗紅色的地毯一路延伸，指引著前方的道路。牆壁被漆成各種深淺不一的紅色，從鮮豔的猩紅到近乎黑色的暗紅，在昏暗的光線下，層層疊疊的紅色彷彿濃稠的血液，營造出一種令人不安的詭譎氛圍。

走廊蜿蜒曲折，彷彿沒有盡頭。我沿途經過一間又一間房門緊閉的房間，門板上雕刻著繁複的花紋，在紅色的基調下顯得格外陰森。壁燈發出微弱的光芒，在牆壁上投下晃動的陰影，彷彿有什麼潛伏在黑暗之中，伺機而動。我不禁加快了腳步，只想盡快離開這令人窒息的紅色迷宮。

終於，在漫長的步行之後，我抵達了一扇裝飾著精緻浮雕的巨大門扉前。推開門，一個宏偉的大廳豁然開朗。這裡顯然是洋館的核心——一個壯麗的王座大廳。

大廳的空間極為開闊，高聳的拱形天花板上繪滿了色彩斑斕的壁畫，描繪著一些奇異的生物和場景，在紅色的月光映照下，顯得格外詭異。大廳中央，一座由不知名銀色金屬打造而成的王座，靜靜地佇立在那裡，散發著冰冷的光澤。

王座之上，坐著一位少女。

她的身形嬌小，卻散發著一股與之不符的威嚴與莊重。她那頭短短的淡藍色短髮，有如暴風雨前的天空，柔和而帶點神秘。最引人注目的是她那雙眼睛，鮮紅如血，彷彿蘊藏著無盡的秘密。

少女頭上戴著一頂淡粉色的帽子，帽子的左側繫著一個巨大的紅色蝴蝶結，鮮豔的紅色在淡粉色的襯托下，顯得格外醒目。而在她的背後，在洋裝的後腰處，同樣也繫著一個巨大的蝴蝶結，與帽子上的蝴蝶結相互呼應。

她以一種威嚴的姿態端坐在王座之上，目光平靜地注視著我，紅色的眼眸中，沒有絲毫的波瀾，卻彷彿能洞穿一切。

「吾乃蕾米莉亞·斯卡蕾特，永遠紅色的幼月，紅魔館的主人。看你似乎在森林裡迷路了，」她接著說道，「晚餐的話，一起來也沒關係。」

直到這時我才發現，自己竟反射性地舉起祿來福相機對準王座。

鐵器破空聲從四面八方襲來,十二柄飛刀自暗處浮現,刀尖距我咽喉僅餘半寸。冷汗滑過後頸時，我沒有意識到女僕何時消失又重現——紅的掌心疊在我的快門按鈕上，溫度比林間積雪更冷。

"讓他拍。"王座上的身影笑出兩顆虎牙。

閃光燈炸裂的瞬間，我在她虹膜深處看見不屬於人類的鏡面反射。那不是倒影，而是某種深紅座標，像子彈穿透防彈玻璃留下的輻射狀裂痕。當視力恢復時，女僕已捧著大理石托盤來到面前，銀色餐罩下滲出松露與鵝肝的香氣。

"就特別允許你在緋紅館留宿一晚吧。"她揚起下巴，水晶吊燈應聲綻放刺目光芒。

她的話語，帶著一種難以言喻的自信，讓人無法不相信。我沉默片刻，最終還是點了點頭。畢竟，身處這片神秘的森林之中，似乎也沒有更好的選擇。更何況，我，一個抱持懷疑態度的塞爾維亞記者，本就為了非凡的新聞故事而來，而眼前的緋紅洋館，以及王座上的少女，不正是最令人好奇的超自然現象嗎？  或許，這趟看似「帶薪假期」的特蘭西瓦尼亞之旅，將會比我預想的更加有趣。
