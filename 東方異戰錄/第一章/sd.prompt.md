I need an image for one of my chapter in my Noval.
I would like to get the prompt for generate the image using FLUX - a Stable Diffusion style Image Generator. I would like to get the prompt for generate the image for the scene. Remember Avoid using the word "lolita" in the prompt as it will make the image illegal.
Here is the description of the scene:
列車駛入喀爾巴阡山隘，清晨的陽光將遠方的雪山染成一片蜂蜜般的金色。車輪與鐵軌規律撞擊的聲音，在空曠的山谷間迴盪，那單調而重複的節奏，竟與報社印刷機運轉時的聲音詭異地重合起來。我望著手提箱裡那疊空白的信紙，思緒有些飄忽。透過柯達布朗尼相機簡陋的取景框，我捕捉到一個牧羊人趕著羊群，鑽入古道間瀰漫的薄霧之中的畫面——多麼完美的「通往異世界之門」的素材啊，這景象要是被德拉甘那個騙子看到，肯定又能編出一個連載三週的鬼故事。

I would like the image to be Anime style and it also looks like it took from a old camera from World World I period.
You can add these features to the prompt as well.

Here are some examples:
```
