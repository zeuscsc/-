I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw.
Following are the key points for current chapter:
After arriving Transylvania, the City feels modern. Feeling it is highly unlikly a real super natural event will exists here. 
Grapped a Local News Paper and found Romanian nationalist movement within Transylvania, which is similar to Serbia.
There were many guards patrolling along the way.
The atmosphere is tense and suffocating.
It only took me a few days to debunk it was another fake super natural event.
The original description about the super natural report:(The Romanian Archaeological Society has discovered the ruins of a Dacian-era altar in Transylvania, inscribed with ancient runes that even a professor at the University of Bucharest could not decipher).
When I finally got back to the the hotel, there was a few days left before going back to Serbia.
So I went to the bar and try to enjoy the remainding holidays.
In the bar I meet a group of teenages, one of them told me his name was Gavrilo.
We had a pleasant conversation and we all agree in order for Serbia to have a future, Austria-Hungary must be expelled from Serbia.
I feel hopeful for Serbia as knowing our teenage care our country so much unlike the readers of those fake super natural stories.
Those teenages told me they where on a school trip here in Transylvania and told me I must visit the village near Bran Castle as they saw something incredible there.
I didn't care much as everything is incredible for teenages but as I am free, I decided to go to the village near Bran Castle.


Following are the key features from pervious chapter:
The main Character is a reporter name Bosco.
The story would be told from his point of view, alike a documentary.
The chapter would be like this:
The year would be right before World World I.
Bosco was working on a Local News Paper in Serbian. They usual publish super natural news.
Bosco doesn't believe in any of those "Super Natural" things and always wanted to report something big, something that will have impact to the world.
This time he was send to Romania for some Ancient Mythology there.
Bosco think he would need to write another "Fake News" again. But it is a "Free" vaction paid by the company, why not enjoy the trip? He thought and start going to Romania.
During the trip to Transylvania, I picked up the news paper I bring from Serbia.
In the news paper they said "The war in Balkan is going well, in May 30, 1913 The two sides held a peace conference in London. Macedonia, which was originally part of the Ottoman Empire, was divided between Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. Thessaloniki was annexed to Greece. Later, Austria-Hungary joined the peace conference and insisted that Albania must be independent."
After reading the News paper I feel deeply offended as Russia was the one who helped us win the war, why will austro-hungarian empire got a say in the Albanian independence!!
All we want was just a Strong and independent Serbia!!!
I put down the News Paper and look at the beautiful view outside to claim myself down.

Remember you need to follow my above points for my current chapter first then reference the following example. Also the example may have too much details that is not related to the main points, too much details may make readers hard to read. Good descriptive ability is important but don't add to much that is not related to the main story points from above. Only give me the final modified version
Following is some extra example from the above outline:
列車駛入特蘭西瓦尼亞盆地時，喀爾巴阡山脈的陰影已然退去，取而代之的是一派現代城市的景象。磚紅屋瓦與鵝卵石街道整潔有序，電車在寬闊的林蔭大道上叮噹作響，時髦的咖啡館外，人們悠閒地翻閱著報紙——這簡直是貝爾格勒的翻版，要說這裡有什麼超自然事件，恐怕還不如相信報紙上的那些鬼故事。我嘲諷地笑了笑，看來這次又是一趟「免費」的假期，只不過地點從貝爾格勒郊外換成了羅馬尼亞而已。

在酒店附近的報攤，我隨手買了一份《克盧日消息報》。頭版並非什麼祭壇謎團，而是一篇措辭激烈的社論，標題是《特蘭西瓦尼亞的羅馬尼亞民族之聲》。文章大肆鼓吹民族自決，聲稱要擺脫外來勢力，建立「大羅馬尼亞」。字裡行間的狂熱，與貝爾格勒那些激進的民族主義者如出一轍，彷彿這股躁動不安的火苗，已從巴爾幹腹地蔓延到了喀爾巴阡山腳下。

街上的氣氛也有些異樣。軍警巡邏隊明顯增加了，他們身穿筆挺的制服，眼神銳利地掃視著路人，彷彿空氣中都瀰漫著緊張與壓迫感。我不禁加快了腳步，只想趕快回到酒店，結束這無聊的「探秘之旅」。

果不其然，「達契亞祭壇古文字之謎」不過是個粗製濫造的謊言。所謂的「古老祭壇」，只不過是幾塊佈滿苔蘚的石頭，那些所謂「難以破解的符文」，也只是些隨意刻畫的痕跡。布加勒斯特大學那位故作神秘的教授，在鏡頭前煞有介事地「研究」著拓印羊皮紙，演戲的成分遠遠大於學術考究。我只花了三天時間，就徹底戳穿了這個拙劣的騙局，向報社發回了題為《特蘭西瓦尼亞「神蹟」調查報告——又一場精心策劃的觀光鬧劇》的電稿。

回到酒店時，距離返回塞爾維亞還有幾天時間。我決定去酒吧消磨一下剩餘的假期。酒吧裡瀰漫著濃烈的啤酒味和喧鬧聲，幾個年輕人圍坐在一張桌子旁，高聲談笑著。其中一個少年注意到我，熱情地招呼我過去。

「先生，您是記者嗎？看您這樣貌，一定有豐富的人生閱歷！」他遞給我一杯啤酒，露出燦爛的笑容。「我叫加夫里洛，和我的朋友們都是從貝爾格勒來的學生。」

我們愉快地聊了起來，從特蘭西瓦尼亞的風土人情，到貝爾格勒的最新動態，無所不談。當話題轉向政治時，加夫里洛的眼神變得銳利起來。「奧匈帝國是我們塞爾維亞的毒瘤，現代化監獄再漂亮終究是監獄。為了塞爾維亞的未來，我們必須將他們徹底驅逐出去！」他揮舞著手臂，慷慨激昂地說道。他的朋友們也紛紛表示贊同，年輕的臉龐上充滿了熱情與希望。

看著這群充滿朝氣的年輕人，我心中忽然湧起一股久違的希望。與那些沉迷於廉價謊言的讀者不同，至少我們的年輕一代，依然心繫國家的未來。

「對了，先生。」臨別時他們給了我一張猩紅色的邀請函，加夫里洛神秘兮兮地對我說，「如果您對神秘事件感興趣，別理會那個祭壇了。去布朗城堡附近的村莊看看吧，我們在那裡看到了一些非常特別的東西……」他頓了頓，臉上露出了青少年特有的誇張神色。「紅霧與赤月，一切都彷彿在紅色濾鏡下。」

年輕人總是容易小題大作。什麼「紅霧與赤月」、「紅色濾鏡下」，多半是誇大其詞的形容。我其實並未放在心上。不過，接下來幾天也沒什麼特別安排，而且離回程還有一段時間，去布朗城堡附近打發時間，似乎也是個不錯的選擇。就當是給自己放鬆一下，順便看看這些年輕人口中的「驚人發現」究竟是怎麼回事吧。
