I would like to write a chapter of a noval in zh-tw.
The main Character is a reporter name Bosco "博斯科".
The story would be told from his point of view, alike a documentary.
The chapter would be like this:
The year would be right before World World I.
Bosco was working on a Local News Paper in Serbian. They usual publish super natural news.
Bosco doesn't believe in any of those "Super Natural" things and always wanted to report something big, something that will have impact to the world.

Here is some extra example from the above outline, remember you need to follow my above points first then reference the following example. Only give me the final modified version:
