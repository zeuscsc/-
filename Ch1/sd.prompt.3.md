I need to create a cover art image for the novel using Stable Diffusion. Can you give me the prompt based on the above chapter? StableDiffusion works better on english prompt, also i would like people to be able to tell it is a Touhou Novel, so focusing on the character will be better.
The image could choose from the photo took by Bosco (the reporter) in anime style.
Avoid using the word "lolita" in the prompt as it will make the image illegal
The image can focus on these:
第一發子彈貫穿斐迪南大公的頸動脈,他仍試圖扶起胸口中彈的蘇菲;第二發則擊碎了他的心肺。人群如炸開的蟻窩潰散,我卻動彈不得——露臺上的少女正俯視這一切,傘尖輕點著警衛腰間的槍套,像是在無聲鼓掌。  
普林齊普被捕時瘋狂嘶吼著塞爾維亞獨立口號,但我的菲林只留下一張照片:頂樓露臺的欄杆上,沾著一枚血指印,形狀宛如蝙蝠展翅。  
you can take reference of 斐迪南大公遇刺事件

Anime-style war documentary photo, 1914 Sarajevo street scene, telephoto lens perspective from rooftop, muted sepia tones with blood-red accents. Central subject Vintage 1910 Graf and Stift convertible car with Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie slumped over seat. Blood splatters on cobblestones. 
bat-wing silhouette formed by bloodstains on the edge of the photo
Photo texture is grainy wartime press camera effect with motion blur on fleeing crowd, faint film scratch overlay, vignette darkening edges.
