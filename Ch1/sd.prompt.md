I need to create a cover art image for the novel using Stable Diffusion. Can you give me the prompt based on the above chapter? StableDiffusion works better on english prompt, also i would like people to be able to tell it is a Touhou Novel, so focusing on the character will be better.
The image could choose from the photo took by Bosco (the reporter) in anime style.
Avoid using the word "lolita" in the prompt as it will make the image illegal
The image can focus on these:
後世史學家反覆分析那張模糊照片,卻沒人注意底片邊緣被雨水暈染的暗紅輪廓──那形狀像極了翅膀收攏的蝙蝠,也像少女屈膝行禮時的裙襬皺摺。

Anime-style war documentary photo, 1914 Sarajevo street scene, telephoto lens perspective from rooftop, muted sepia tones with blood-red accents. Central subject Vintage 1910 Graf and Stift convertible car with Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie slumped over seat. Blood splatters on cobblestones.
